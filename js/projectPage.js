                    An individual project for the course DH2321 Information Visualization at KTH
                    We were asked to investigate the WVS data and how they visualized it. 
                    The task was to make a better visualization with the data of our choosing. 
                    This is the result of my visualization of the data “The importance of children’s qualities”.
                    This project was setup with D3.js

                    iParkInStan is a native app made with React Native. 
                    It uses Stockholm Stad’s API together with Google Maps API to give the user a quick and easy 
                    way, with geolocation, to see which streets in the near vicinity where they are able to park. 
                    The user will see a map where available streets are marked in green. 
                    Clicking theses streets will give further information eg. how long they’re allowed to be parked 
                    there or if there are ticket kiosks.

                    To compare different types of control modalities we decided to create a game, PongAR, 
                    which allows both gesture and touch control in an augmented reality playing field. 
                    PongAR is a game inspired by the old classic game Pong and a flash game called CurveBall. 
                    With these games as inspiration and with Unity as the game engine of choice a simple game 
                    where the goal was to bounce a ball against a wall as many times as possible was created.
